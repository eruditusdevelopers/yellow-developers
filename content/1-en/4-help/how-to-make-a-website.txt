Learn how to make your own website. [See demo](/).

## Install website

1. [Download and unzip Datenstrom Yellow](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow/archive/master.zip).
2. Copy all files to your web hosting.
3. Open your website in a web browser.

Your website is immediately available. The installation comes with two pages, 'Home' and 'About'. This is just an example to get you started, change everything as you like. You can make a website by adding more files and folders.

When there are problems, please check the [server configuration](server-configuration) or ask the [support](support).

## Writing web pages

Have a look inside your `content` folder, here are all your web pages. Open the file `content/1-home/page.txt`. You'll see settings and text of the page. You can change `Title` and other [settings](markdown-cheat-sheet#settings) at the top of a page. Here's an example:

```
---
Title: Home
---
Your website works! 

[edit - You can edit this page] or use your text editor. 
```

To create a new page, add a new file to the home folder or another `content` folder. To add something to the navigation, create a new folder with a numerical prefix. Only folders with a prefix are shown in the navigation. Here's another example page:

```
---
Title: Datenstrom Yellow is for people who make websites
---
[edit - You can edit this page]. The help gives you more information 
about how to create small web pages, blogs and wikis.
```

Now let's add an image:

```

[edit - You can edit this page]. The help gives you more information 
about how to create small web pages, blogs and wikis.
```

Let's show a different title in the navigation:

```

TitleNavigation: Home
---
[image picture.jpg Example rounded]

[edit - You can edit this page]. The help gives you more information 
about how to create small web pages, blogs and wikis.
```

You can use [Markdown](markdown-cheat-sheet) to edit web pages.

## Showing a sidebar

To show a sidebar add the file `sidebar.txt` to a `content` folder. The sidebar will be shown on all pages in the same folder. You can decide if you like to have a sidebar or not. Here's an example sidebar:

```
