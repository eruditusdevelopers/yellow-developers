All media is located in the `media` folder. You can store your images and other files here.

The `downloads` folder contains files to download. The `images` folder is the place to store your images. For a small website put all images inside this folder. You can also create additional folders and organise files as you like. The `thumbnails` folder contains image thumbnails.

## Downloads

You can offer files to download. To add a new download, copy a new file into the `downloads` folder and create a [link](markdown-cheat-sheet). All file types and file sizes can be downloaded, there are no restrictions. Here's an example:

    [Download file](/media/downloads/yellow.pdf)

## Images

You can use the [image plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/image) to embed images. To add a new image, copy a new file into the `images` folder and create an `[image]` shortcut. The image formats GIF, JPG, PNG and SVG are supported. Here's an example:

    [image picture.jpg]
    [image picture.jpg Picture]
    [image picture.jpg "This is an example image"]

Images in different styles:

    [image picture.jpg Example left]
    [image picture.jpg Example centre]
    [image picture.jpg Example right]

Images in different sizes:

    [image picture.jpg Example - 64 64]
    [image picture.jpg Example - 320 200]
    [image picture.jpg Example - 50%]

## Video

You can use the [Youtube plugin](https://github.com/datenstrom/yellow-plugins/tree/master/youtube) to embed videos:
